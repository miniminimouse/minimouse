Ah! I see the issue now. You’re saying that within each variable, ALL the “better quality” bins show the exact same number, and ALL the “worse quality” bins show the exact same number. That’s definitely wrong.

The problem is in the detailed analysis function - I’m calculating the totals once and then assigning them to every row. Here’s the fix:

```python
def distribution_shift_analysis(baseline_data, current_data, var_dict, bins=10):
    """
    compare how aggregate distributions shift between baseline and current periods
    accounts for whether higher values are better or worse for each variable
    """
    
    results = {}
    
    for var, higher_is_better in var_dict.items():
        print(f"\n=== Distribution Analysis for {var} ===")
        print(f"Direction: {'Higher is better' if higher_is_better else 'Lower is better'}")
        
        # create consistent bins based on baseline data
        baseline_bins = pd.qcut(baseline_data[var], q=bins, duplicates='drop')
        bin_edges = baseline_bins.cat.categories
        
        # apply same bins to both datasets
        baseline_binned = pd.cut(baseline_data[var], bins=[interval.left for interval in bin_edges] + [bin_edges[-1].right], include_lowest=True)
        current_binned = pd.cut(current_data[var], bins=[interval.left for interval in bin_edges] + [bin_edges[-1].right], include_lowest=True)
        
        # get distribution percentages
        baseline_dist = baseline_binned.value_counts(normalize=True).sort_index() * 100
        current_dist = current_binned.value_counts(normalize=True).sort_index() * 100
        
        # combine for comparison
        comparison = pd.DataFrame({
            'Baseline_Pct': baseline_dist,
            'Current_Pct': current_dist
        }).fillna(0)
        
        # calculate the shift
        comparison['Pct_Point_Change'] = comparison['Current_Pct'] - comparison['Baseline_Pct']
        comparison['Relative_Change'] = ((comparison['Current_Pct'] / comparison['Baseline_Pct']) - 1) * 100
        
        # add bin labels - adjust based on direction
        comparison['Bin_Rank'] = range(1, len(comparison) + 1)
        
        if higher_is_better:
            # for vars like credit score: higher bins = better quality
            comparison['Quality_Category'] = ['Worst' if x <= bins//4 else 'Bad' if x <= bins//2 else 'Good' if x <= 3*bins//4 else 'Best' 
                                            for x in comparison['Bin_Rank']]
            better_bins_mask = comparison['Bin_Rank'] > bins//2
        else:
            # for vars like debt_to_income: lower bins = better quality  
            comparison['Quality_Category'] = ['Best' if x <= bins//4 else 'Good' if x <= bins//2 else 'Bad' if x <= 3*bins//4 else 'Worst' 
                                            for x in comparison['Bin_Rank']]
            better_bins_mask = comparison['Bin_Rank'] <= bins//2
        
        # FIXED: calculate total shifts (not per-bin values)
        better_quality_shift = comparison[better_bins_mask]['Pct_Point_Change'].sum()
        worse_quality_shift = comparison[~better_bins_mask]['Pct_Point_Change'].sum()
        
        print(f"Net shift to BETTER quality bins: {better_quality_shift:+.1f} percentage points")
        print(f"Net shift to WORSE quality bins: {worse_quality_shift:+.1f} percentage points")
        
        if better_quality_shift > 2:
            print("✅ New borrowers are concentrating in BETTER quality buckets")
        elif abs(worse_quality_shift) > 2:  # fixed: use abs here since worse_quality_shift might be negative
            print("⚠️  New borrowers are concentrating in WORSE quality buckets") 
        else:
            print("➡️  Distribution is relatively stable")
        
        # FIXED: don't add these totals to every row - they're summary stats
        comparison['Variable'] = var
        comparison['Higher_Is_Better'] = higher_is_better
        
        print("\nDetailed breakdown:")
        display_cols = ['Bin_Rank', 'Quality_Category', 'Baseline_Pct', 'Current_Pct', 'Pct_Point_Change']
        print(comparison[display_cols].round(1))
        
        # store the summary stats separately
        comparison.attrs['better_quality_shift'] = better_quality_shift
        comparison.attrs['worse_quality_shift'] = worse_quality_shift
        
        results[var] = comparison
    
    return results
```

Now each bin will show its own individual `Pct_Point_Change` (which should vary by bin), and the summary totals are calculated correctly but not added as columns to every row.

The issue was I was calculating `better_quality_shift` and `worse_quality_shift` once per variable and then adding those same summary numbers to every single bin row, which made no sense. Now each bin shows its own change, and the summary is just printed/stored separately.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
